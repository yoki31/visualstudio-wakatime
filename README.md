Microsoft [does not allow][express article] extensions for Visual Studio Express edition in the gallery.
To use WakaTime for Visual Studio Express, download and install [WakaTime for Express][latest release].

Alternatively, you may clone the github repo and build the extension using the `Express` build profile.
The resulting `bin/Express/WakaTime.vsix` extension file will install into Visual Studio Express when run.

## Contributing

To open and build this project, please use Visual Studio 2019.

For debugging, configure the product to open in a new Visual Studio instance:

1. Open the project properties (ALT + ENTER)
2. In the Debug tab, set to Start external program. e.g: ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe```
3. Add command line arguments: ```/rootsuffix Exp```
4. Change the solution according to the version of Visual Studio you're targeting:

* Release - Visual Studio 2015+

> Note: The Debug solution is only for including debugger symbols.

## Troubleshooting

Look for a `Tools` → `WakaTime Settings` menu in Visual Studio.
If that menu doesn't exist, something prevented the WakaTime extension from loading.

Turn on debug mode from `Tools` → `WakaTime Settings`.

Are there error messages in your Visual Studio Output window?

Open the Output window from `View` → `Output` (`ctrl` + `alt` + `O`).

![Output Window](Dev17/Assets/output-window.png)

If there are no messages in your Visual Studio Output window, check your `.wakatime.log` file:

`C:\Users\<user>\.wakatime.log`

Lastly, uncaught exceptions go to [ActivityLog.xml][activitylog]. Uncaught exceptions are rare, so check your ActivityLog.xml only after checking your Output Window and `.wakatime.log` file.

The [How to Debug Plugins][how to debug] guide shows how to check when coding activity was last received from your IDE using the [User Agents API][user agents api].
